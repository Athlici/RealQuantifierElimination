# RealQuantifierElimination
Collection of material on RQE from my masters thesis.

##QEPCAD
--------
Materials associated with the QEPCAD software.

###build172.sh
Build script for QEPCAD 1.72, mirrored from a Japanese source.

###qepcad.sh
Tiny QEPCAD wrapper for Mathematica. Sets an environment variable and the cell number (memory usage).

###Interface.m
Library of functions in Mathematica to export to and import from QEPCAD.

## Models
---------

### GuardQEP
Quantifier Elimination Problem formulation of root types for resolution in Mathematica. Usefull only for small amount of roots.

### RRTModels-Deg4
Quantifier Elimination Problem formulation of guards and virtual substitutions with real root types in QEPCAD. QEPCAD fails for degree 4 substitutions in polynomials of degree >=2.

## Other
--------

### MA
Main document for my masters thesis, contains the algorithm, complexity derivations and more.

### Visualisations
Code for all the graphics in my thesis.

### Simplify
Some semi-effective algorithms for simplification as well as some ideas for CAD based approaches.

### Tables
All the most simplified versions of the formulas that I could find.

### Heart
Example of a semi-algebraic set. Credit for finding it goes to the TU Kaiserslauten Algebra Group.
